for dreams

Vision.
Envisioning a future where code deployment becomes almost self-driven through prompts and data is fully user-owned.
We are working to bring this vision closer with the development of a Dream Manager AI to test the boundaries of automation. 
Privacy and anonymity are top priorities, with a focus on creating tamper-proof code. 
Leveraging n8n, we aim to enable highly versatile, prompt-based automation and are experimenting with bridging web3 technologies and n8n. 
Using ZK (zero-knowledge) for enhanced privacy and Lukso for adaptability, we plan to introduce the necessary modules to bridge n8n with the Lukso ecosystem.
